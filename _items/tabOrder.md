Some users with visual impairments will use screen readers to help them access a webpage – similarly, users with physical disabilities will often use the keyboard when accessing the web. It’s important to make sure your websites design/layout is compatible for both types of users. Try tabbing around this site - notice how all links highlight in order as you tab, and there is a hidden link to allow keyboard users to jump straight to the main content of the page.
