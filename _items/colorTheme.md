Some users have a hard time or experience discomfort when reading black text on a white background. Other users have similar issues with white text on a black background. Using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query allows web developers to automatically provide a light or dark theme based on the users preferences within their OS. This has limited support on older systems, but is fully supported in the newest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge running on MacOS Mojave, Windows 10 October 2018, Android 10, and iOS 13 or newer. For more info on how to use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query see the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).

This entire site is designed with both a light and dark mode in mind. If you are running one of the afformentioned browsers and systems try changing your system to Dark or Light mode and watching the site adapt to your new settings.
