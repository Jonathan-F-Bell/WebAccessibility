Color contrast is also extremely important in web accessible design. Ensure that overlapping colors/text have sufficient contrast from their background. Here is a source that will check your contrast ratios for you: [usecontrast.com](https://usecontrast.com/). This website utilizes two distinct and alternating color palettes (which are dependent on user preferences) to help those with visual impairments (black on white & white on black). We have designed two different logos with these needs in mind.

According to one [source](https://www.rgd.ca/database/files/library/RGD_AccessAbility_Handbook.pdf), 5% of people exhibit actual color blindness â€“ textures and patterns are great alternatives and substitutes to help relay important information.
